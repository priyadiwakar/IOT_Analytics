Time Series Forecasting

Utilized three forecasting algorithms to determine the best model for a time series.
Fit a simple moving average model, exponential smoothing model and AR model.
Compared the models based on predicted values and accuracy.

Task 1. Check for stationarity
Task 2. Fit a simple moving average model (use the training set)
Task 3. Fit an exponential smoothing model (use the training set)
Task 4. Fit an AR(p) model (use the training set)
